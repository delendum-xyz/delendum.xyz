## Introduction

Future Computing Research Workshop is an event designed to bring together leading experts in the field of computing to discuss the latest advancements in the industry as well as exploring new tools and constructions together. The workshop will focus on a wide range of topics, including verifiable computation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, quantum computing, and more.

Throughout the workshop, attendees will have the opportunity to participate in interactive sessions, hear keynote speeches from industry leaders, and network with other researchers and professionals in the field. The event will also feature a poster session where attendees can present their own research and receive feedback from their peers.

We are expecting a wide range of attendees from different backgrounds and we will provide facilities for online participation as well.

### Goal

Advance cooperation at the intersection of cryptography, theoretical computer science, and blockchain.

### Format

Short presentations on selected avenues for progress (10 minutes each, 5 mins Q & A)

Working groups to explore collaborations on avenues for progress (2 hours)

Final presentations on promising avenues for progress (10 minutes each, 5 mins Q & A)

## Apply to speak

Please reach out to research@delendum.xyz and fill out this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc71LWseHL_Kmxi31fioBb8KIyBoVHD_7TkXCBi97WO79Jt0g/viewform) if you are interested in becoming a speaker.

Note that speakers are expected to bring personal opinions and ideas to this workshop. The presentations should not be related to the current project participants are working on, but rather original, exploratory topics that lead to the creation of new methods, constructions and tools.

We do not provide speaker slots to sponsors or donators.

We are committed to providing our audience with the most engaging and informative experience possible, and as such, we carefully select speakers based on the relevance, maturity, and impact of their research proposal. We seek out individuals who are at the forefront of their field and can offer unique insights and perspectives. 

Additionally, we prioritize proposals that demonstrate maturity in both the research design and execution, as well as a clear understanding of the potential impact of the research. Our goal is to foster meaningful dialogue and discussion, and we believe that selecting speakers based on these criteria will help us achieve that goal.

## Introduction

Delendum fellowship is a nonprofit two-month program to support research and development tackling hard problems in blockchain and the frontiers of zero-knowledge.

If you are interested in working together with top experts to explore practical use cases of new research ideas, or to work on one of the topics we discussed in "What to build next" [blog series](https://delendum.xyz/2022/11/22/what-to-build-next-in-zero-knowledge.html), please consider applying to our [fellowship program](https://delendum.xyz/fellow). We are also open to development proposals for concrete solutions of other significant problems.

For a research fellow, you will be collaborating with researchers on original, exploratory topics that lead to the creation of new use cases in practice. For a developer fellow, you will be working with other builders to create new products, with feedback on product feasibility and implementation.

### Mentorship

This program provides access to:

- daily office hours with our team members and external mentors to cover the cryptography, engineering, product development aspects of your project
- weekly research discussion session, joint brainstorming session, external collaboration session, cross-review process to review your work in progress 
- engineering and research resources from our team and network 
- co-publishing opportunities

Our mentors include (alphabetically ordered):

- Alan Szepieniec - Post-Quantum Cryptography, Hash Function, Gröbner basis algorithms
- Bobbin Threadbare - Virtual Machines, Zero-Knowledge Proofs

### Evaluation

We will evaluate applications on a rolling basis. Typically, we will get back to you within a week. Since we have very limited capacity (5 fellows), the early applicants generally get a better chance. 

### Location

The fellowship program is remote friendly, but we do prefer working together in our upcoming office in San Francisco. 

### Contact us

If you have any questions regarding the program itself, please do not hesitate to contact us at research@delendum.xyz. For donations and sponsorship related matters, please contact us at hello@delendum.xyz.

We are also looking for two volunteers who will maintain the associated open learning resources or help administer the program. If you are interested, please reach out to us at hello@delendum.xyz.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### I am working under an existing organization. Can I apply?

It is absolutely fine that you are working under an existing organization, but the research or development outcome of this fellowship will need to be general purpose, open-sourced and beneficial to the long-term growth of this industry. 

#### What is the maximum length of the proposal?

There is no maximum or minimum length as long as you articulate the problem and its solution. The average length we received so far is 4-6 pages. There are applicants who submitted over 10 pages before and were accepted.

#### What is the time commitment of fellowship?

It is less than most applicants expect; 5-10 hours per week if you participate in all the recommended activities. All parts of the program are optional.

#### Where does the fellowship happen? Do I need to move to San Francisco?

The batch starts with an in-person initial presentation and ends with an in-person final presentation, both in San Francisco. For the weeks in between, you can participate remotely and do not have to be in the Bay Area. Office hours and weekly presentations will be online. However, we encourage teams to work together in our office in person.

#### I am located outside the US now. Can I join the fellowship program in this case?

You may. However, since most of our mentors and other fellows are based in the United States, you may need to adjust your schedule to fit theirs.

#### What are the dates for the next batch?

All the relevant dates are [here](https://delendum.xyz/fellow).

#### This batch isn't a good time for me. Can I apply to the one after?

Yes. We offer early decision for all batches, and you just need to mention it somewhere on the application.

#### What is a fellow's schedule like during the fellowship?

*Here is an example of the weekly schedule for one of our fellows.*

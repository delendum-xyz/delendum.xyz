## Introducing our fellowship program

If you are interested in working together with top experts to explore practical use cases of new research ideas, or to work on one of the topics we discussed in "What to build next" [blog series](https://delendum.xyz/2022/11/11/what-to-build-next-in-zero-knowledge.html), please consider applying to our [fellowship program](https://delendum.xyz/fellow). We are also open to development proposals for concrete solutions of other significant problems.


Delendum fellowship is a two-month program to support research and development advancing the frontiers of zero-knowledge. We have daily office hours with our team members and external experts to cover the cryptography, engineering, product development sides of your project; weekly paper discussion session, joint brainstorming session, external collaboration session, cross-review process to review your work in progress; engineering and research resources from our team and network; co-publishing opportunities.

To give a more concrete idea of the experience, here is the schedule of one of our fellows:

For a research fellow, you will be collaborating with researchers on original, exploratory topics that lead to the creation of new use cases in practice. For a developer fellow, you will be working with other builders to create new products, with feedback from on product feasibility and implementation.

We will evaluate applications monthly on a rolling basis. Typically, we will get back to you within a week. Since we have very limited capacity (3 fellows per month), the early applicants in that month generally get a better chance. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at research@delendum.xyz.

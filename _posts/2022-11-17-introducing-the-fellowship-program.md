Delendum fellowship is a two-month program to support research and development tackling hard problems in blockchain and the frontiers of zero-knowledge.

If you are interested in working together with top experts to explore practical use cases of new research ideas, or to work on one of the topics we discussed in "What to build next" [blog series](https://delendum.xyz/2022/11/11/what-to-build-next-in-zero-knowledge.html), please consider applying to our [fellowship program](https://delendum.xyz/fellow). We are also open to development proposals for concrete solutions of other significant problems.

For a research fellow, you will be collaborating with researchers on original, exploratory topics that lead to the creation of new use cases in practice. For a developer fellow, you will be working with other builders to create new products, with feedback on product feasibility and implementation.

We have daily office hours with our team members and external experts to cover the cryptography, engineering, product development aspects of your project; weekly research discussion session, joint brainstorming session, external collaboration session, cross-review process to review your work in progress; engineering and research resources from our team and network; co-publishing opportunities.

Our mentors include: 

- Bobbin Threadbare - Virtual Machines, Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- Brian Retford - Compiler, Transpiler, Language
- Zaki Manian - Tendermint, Protocol Development
- Alan Szepieniec - Post-Quantum Cryptography, Hash Function
- Christopher Goes - IBC, Protocol Development
- Daniel Lubarov - Language, Proving System, Arithmetic Optimizations
- Shashank Agrawal - Multi-Party Computation, Zero-Knowledge Proofs

The deadline for 2023 Jan - Feb fellowship application is 2022 Nov 30. We will evaluate applications on a rolling basis. Typically, we will get back to you within a week. Since we have very limited capacity (5 fellows), the early applicants in that month generally get a better chance. 

The fellowship program is remote friendly, but we do prefer working together in our office in San Francisco. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at research@delendum.xyz.

Here is the schedule of one of our fellows:

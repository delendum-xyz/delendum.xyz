We are a team of dedicated engineers and researchers who are committed to making trustless and private computation pragmatic and useful. Our primary objective is to provide developers with the necessary tools and infrastructure to build secure, reliable, and scalable decentralized applications.

At the core of our company lies our unwavering commitment to open source development. We firmly believe that transparent and collaborative systems can unlock the full potential of blockchain technology. To this end, we are working on a range of open source infrastructure and services that aim to enhance developer productivity and performance.

Our efforts extend beyond technological advancement. We are proud to have established a non-profit division, Delendum Research, which offers mentorship and hosts various non- profit programs like the fellowship and residency program. Through this initiative, we aim to provide talented individuals with the resources and support necessary to explore and innovate in the intersection of theoretical computer science, cryptography and distributed system.

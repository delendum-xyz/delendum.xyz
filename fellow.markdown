### Goal
A two-month program to support research and development advancing the frontiers of zero-knowledge

### Benefit
**Research**: collaborating with researchers on original, exploratory topics that leads to the creation of new methods and constructions

**Development**: working with the pioneers and builders in this field to create new products and systems, with support from our team members regarding evaluation and implementation
